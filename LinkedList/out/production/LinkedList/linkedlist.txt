
Single Linked List : linear data structure where each element is a separate object
                     where each element comprises of two items
                        1) data
                        2) reference to next node
                        3) keep record the variable size

                    only one data element can be reached from a given point


Circular Single Linked List: it is exactly same as single linked list except the last
                    element of circular single linked list points to the first element
                    of circular single linked list
                    head : address of first element
                    tail : address of last element
                    last -> first  : connected

Double Linked List: in double linked list each node contain two reference.
                    that reference to previous and next node

Circular Double Linked List: int he case of circular doubly linked list, the only change
                    that occurs is that the end of given list is linked back to the front
                    of the list and vice versa
                    * last one connects to the first one to form a circle
